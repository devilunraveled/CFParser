# CFParser

## Basic Features :

1. Use Codeforces API to extract user information based on user handle.
2. Parse the CodeForces website to extract details about a particular problem such as :
     1. Problem Title
     2. Time and Memory Constraints
     3. Problem Statement
     4. Input/Output Description
     5. Input(s) / Output (s) based on examples
     6. Additional Note regarding the examples
3. Creating a pdf file based on the questions gathered from parser.

### Next Feature In Development :

Adding support for live-contests

> **_Note:_** For interactive problems and problems that have diagrams/figures, support is not yet added, **DO NOT** use the parser for such problems as the complete problem/parts of it may not be accesible to you.
